These notes are for the EDITORS of hancestro

This project was created using the [ontology starter kit](https://github.com/cmungall/ontology-starter-kit). See the site for details.

For more details on ontology management, please see the [OBO tutorial](https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obo-tutorial) or the [Gene Ontology Editors Tutorial](go-protege-tutorial.readthedocs.io)

## Editors Version

Make sure you have an ID range in the [idranges file](hancestro-idranges.owl)

If you do not have one, get one from the head curator.

The editors version is [hancestro-edit.owl](hancestro-edit.owl)

** DO NOT EDIT hancestro.obo OR hancestro.owl in the top level directory **

[../../hancestro.owl](../../hancestro.owl) is the release version

To edit, open the file in Protege. First make sure you have the repository cloned, see [the GitHub project](https://github.com/daniwelter/human-ancestry-ontology) for details.

## ID Ranges

These are stored in the file

 * [hancestro-idranges.owl](hancestro-idranges.owl)

** ONLY USE IDs WITHIN YOUR RANGE!! **

If you have only just set up this repository, modify the idranges file
and add yourself or other editors. Note Protege does not read the file
- it is up to you to ensure correct Protege configuration.


### Setting ID ranges in Protege

We aim to put this up on the technical docs for OBO on http://obofoundry.org/

For now, consult the [GO Tutorial on configuring Protege](http://go-protege-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Entities.html#new-entities)


## Release Manager notes

You should only attempt to make a release AFTER the edit version is
committed and pushed, and the travis build passes.

to release:

    cd src/ontology
    make

If this looks good type:

    make prepare_release

This generates derived files such as hancestro.owl and hancestro.obo and places
them in the top level (../..). The versionIRI will be added.

Commit and push these files.

    git commit -a

And type a brief description of the release in the editor window

Finally type

    git push origin main

IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS (do *not* make further modifications) go here:

 * https://github.com/EBISPOT/ancestro/releases
 * https://github.com/EBISPOT/ancestro/releases/new

The value of the "Tag version" field MUST be

    X.Y

where X represents the major version number and Y the minor version number. For patch releases (eg non-label typo corrections or bug fixes), the version number should be X.Y.Z where Z represents the patch number.

Release title should be `HANCESTRO release X.Y`, optionally followed by a title (e.g. "january release")

Then click "publish release"

__IMPORTANT__: NO MORE THAN ONE RELEASE PER DAY.

The PURLs are already configured to pull from github. This means that
BOTH ontology purls and versioned ontology purls will resolve to the
correct ontologies. Try it!

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hancestro.owl <-- current ontology PURL
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/hancestro/releases/YYYY-MM-DD.owl <-- change to the release you just made
